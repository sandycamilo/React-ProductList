# Reac-Product-List

### Map ||  Filter || Reduce: 
Map - transform all elements of an array. 

For example, take an array of objects and turn them into an array of Strings. Here you'd be starting with an array of Objects and creating an array of strings. Transform Object to String.

Filter - create a new Array that is a subset of the source array. 

For example, take an array of product objects and return an array of products with the category "Books". Here you'd have started with an array of products in all categories and create a new array of products of only one category.

Reduce - create a new value from a source array. Usually this will be a single value but there isn't any rule that says you can't make an object from an array.

For example, you might take an array of products and get a sum of of the prices for all products. Here you started with an array of products and ended with a number.
